## Critical Deadline

**Apply for Spotify Extended API Access before May 15, 2025** - After this date, approval becomes significantly harder.

## The Story Behind This

This project was born from a real need - the frustration of not being able to communicate life's emotional complexity to music services. After being laid off, I wanted music that understood both the disappointment and the excitement of finally having time to build my AI apps. Current playlist generators just don't get it.

## MVP Target

Ultra-simple launch focusing on:
1. Authentication (Spotify OAuth)
2. Playlist generation from emotional prompts
3. Basic playback

Everything else comes later.
